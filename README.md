### Continued development

I would like to recreate this project using a better navigation, to have a better user exeperience in my page.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to know how to implement a better navigation in my page, I tried with history.back() adding "click" event on my button element, but in this context it didn't function, I suppose because at the moement that I'm calling the function to render the HTML is creating the button, so It do not have like a "history" of it. I would appreciate any feedback to take advantage of it!.
